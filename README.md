This project was proposed to estimate the time to complete it as a test task.
I did not use a timer and spent +-1 hour on each section. I didn't succeed in something, 
I simplified something for functionality. Also, since this was my initiative work,
I did not develop additional 8 pages, as I did not have an explanation for their use and functioning for the project.
I tried to implement what I considered readable in 1 popup.
There is only a mobile version 325 px and a desktop 1440 px.
